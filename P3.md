#### Rationale
End to End Testing verifies the flow of the the whole system, including various sub-systems detecting issues with them.
So, it avoids a big risk that is the complete failure of the system. If any sub-system fails, the whole system will collapse.
And end to end testing validates the entire system including its integration with external interfaces.

#### Rationale
End-to-End testing is used to validate the entire system along with its integration with external interfaces. 
As there are multiple different sub-systems the system must be able to run across the majority, if any of the sub-systems 
fails, the whole system could collapse. This is a major risk and can be avoided by End-to-End testing because it verifies 
the complete system flow. It increases Test coverage of various sub-systems and helps detect issues with them.

#### Commands defined
