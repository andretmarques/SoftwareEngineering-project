### Service profiling

We used the [Async Profiler](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/async-profiler.html).

#### Screenshots of summary reports




#### Discussion of findings

We think our service is well optimized. We found out that software engineering is a tradeof
between good clean code and perfomance. And we only should opt for perfomance when necessary.
So, yes, we conclude our service is well optimized.
